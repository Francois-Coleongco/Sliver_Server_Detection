weird port

encrypted traffic

interacts with the /dev/ptmx to spawn a /dev/pts/* shell

lots of keep alive 66 byte size packets (NOTE JUST CUZ THERE ARE LOTS OF KEEPALIVES DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS MALICIOUS. IT JUST MEANS THAT THE PROGRAM IS TRYING TO KEEP A NETWORK CONNECTION ALIVE. USE ONLY IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER KILL_ATTRIBUTES)
    
    example of sliver keep alive packet. NOTE there is  ACK=true

    and a FUCK ton of it

    
    example of sliver command packet. NOTE there is no

note the commands sent via the subprocess are shown in keystrokes in strace, so you can intercept the execution of a command by killing the process before the command is entered. you could use a AI model to interpret the parsed strace output (parse on the write syscalls)
